   <h2>Cats are low maintenance</h2>
   <h3>external css example</h3>
   <p> If noise levels are a concern in your living situation, cats are a great choice of pet. <br>Even the quietest bark will likely be much louder than the most insistent meowing. <br>Depending on the cat, you may need to worry about other sounds such as them knocking things off of surfaces or running around at top speed, but they are still likely to be more quiet overall.</p>
   <p id="myid">Compared to dogs, cats are a low maintenance pet. <br>They don’t require formal training, they don’t need to be taken out multiple times a day, and they’re even able to take care of basic self-cleaning. <br>Of course, long-haired cats will still require regular grooming, but it will likely involve less regular grooming than long-haired dogs.</p>
   <h3 class="myclass">Cats are easy to house-train</h3>
   <p class="myclass"> One of the biggest challenges dog owners need to overcome is the process of house-training a new puppy. <br> Kittens, on the other hand, usually know how to use the litter box as soon as you bring them home. <br> All you need to do is show them where it is, and they’ll instinctively use it.</p>
